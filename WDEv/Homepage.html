                My main contributions to this game is the power-up system. This consists of 2 different powerups: boost which gives a
              short speed boost as well as ghost, which lets the player pass through obstacles on the track. </li>

                My main contributions to this game is the equipment system. There are 3 different types of guns: Minigun,Pulsar gun and
              Missile Launcher. Minigun shoots fast but has low damage, pulsar gun is average in both and Missile Launcher is slow but has
            high damage. Players are allowed to pick 2 guns and mix and match them. </li>
